## 📘 README Overview (Recommended)

> **Modern Space Politics (Chuseigaku)** is a speculative, metaphor-driven framework for observing structural acceleration in technology, economics, and human agency.  
> Through a three-part narrative arc, it reinterprets contemporary phenomena using mythological and science-fictional language as analytical tools.  
> 
> This repository records not predictions or prescriptions, but an interpretive model for how existing measurement systems lose coherence under computation-driven change.  
> 
> Readers are invited to observe the structure, not to adopt its conclusions.


## 📘 Reading Notice / Interpretive Framework (Three-Part Edition)

> **This repository presents a three-part speculative observation, not a doctrine, forecast, or policy proposal.**
> 
> _Modern Space Politics (Chuseigaku)_ is a metaphor-driven interpretive framework that examines perceived accelerations and structural shifts in technology, economics, and human agency through a narrative and mythological lens.
> 
> Although this work adopts the format of “logs,” “analysis,” and “declarations,” these forms are **literary and conceptual devices**, not claims of objective measurement or insider knowledge.
> 
> References to real individuals, corporations, nations, technologies, dates, or numerical values are employed **symbolically, allegorically, or contextually**. They do **not** represent factual assertions, predictions, endorsements, or statements of intent by the referenced entities.
> 
> Scientific, economic, and political terminology within this text may be used **analogically rather than literally**. Expressions such as “particles,” “infinite,” “deployment,” “singularity,” or “awakening” describe **qualitative transitions, shifts in scale, or experiential thresholds**, not empirically testable claims.
> 
> The three parts should be read as a continuous conceptual arc:
> 
> - **Part 1** frames the loss of existing measurement systems and the onset of acceleration.
>     
> - **Part 2** explores divergence, selection, and asymmetric adaptation within that acceleration.
>     
> - **Part 3** adopts a declarative and mythic tone to illustrate irreversible separation and commitment.
>     
> 
> This progression reflects a **change in narrative mode**, not an escalation from analysis to advocacy.
> 
> This work does **not** offer financial advice, technological roadmaps, political ideology, or guidance for action. Agreement, belief, or rejection are unnecessary.
> 
> The reader is invited only to **observe the structure**, not to accept its conclusions.
