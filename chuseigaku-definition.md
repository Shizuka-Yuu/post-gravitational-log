### Chuseigaku — A Conceptual Definition

> **Chuseigaku (宙政学)** is a conceptual framework for observing how “gravity” embedded in technology, economics, and social systems shapes human perception, decision-making, and responsibility structures.
> 
> In this context, _gravity_ does not refer to physical force, but to the often-unnoticed assumptions, incentives, infrastructures, interfaces, and optimization pressures that continuously pull individuals and societies back toward particular modes of judgment and behavior.
> 
> Chuseigaku(宙政学) is not a theory of reform, a political ideology, or a predictive model.  
> It records **how the world becomes visible once those gravitational premises are recognized as gravity**.

### Gravity as a Concept

> Within Chuseigaku(宙政学), _gravity_ denotes the totality of forces that stabilize perception:
> 
> - ROI and efficiency metrics in economics
>     
> - Comfort and usability norms in technology
>     
> - Legal, ethical, and cultural defaults in society
>     
> - “Convenience” and “optimal answers” in AI systems
>     
> 
> These forces are not chains.  
> Yet departure from them is structurally difficult.
> 
> This condition is referred to as the **gravity sphere**.

### Atmospheric Escape of Perception

> When gravity is understood as a concept rather than a given, perception undergoes what Chuseigaku(宙政学) calls **atmospheric escape**.
> 
> Atmospheric escape does not require physical withdrawal from society, rejection of technology, or ideological opposition.
> 
> What escapes is not the body, but the **point of view**.
> 
> From this position, existing systems are no longer experienced as neutral realities, but as contingent structures with specific trade-offs, speeds, and allocation logics.

### Why “Chusei” (宙)

> The term _chusei_ (宙) does not signify outer space or transcendence.
> 
> It refers to a **non-grounded intermediate state** —  
> no longer fixed to the surface of inherited assumptions,  
> yet not stabilized into a new doctrine or system.
> 
> Chuseigaku(宙政学) describes perception in this suspended state.

### Why “Gaku” (学)

> Chuseigaku(宙政学) is called a _gaku_ (学) not because it claims academic authority, but because it seeks to **observe, name, and record structural phenomena** with internal consistency.
> 
> It does not instruct action.  
> It does not demand belief.
> 
> It documents how decision-making, allocation, and responsibility appear once gravitational premises lose their inevitability.
